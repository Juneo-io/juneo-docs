# Supernet Bridge

### What is the Supernet Bridge?

Supernet Bridge is a cross-chain bridging protocol built on ChainSafe’s modular architecture. Designed for minimal trust assumptions and maximum efficiency, it enables seamless asset transfers across multiple blockchain networks and leverages light client verification and optimized relayer mechanisms to maintain low latency and secure interoperability.\
\
This interoperability layer simplifies token transfers between origin and target chains while preserving asset integrity and minimizing reliance on external validators. Additionally, its modular framework allows for future upgrades and optimizations, with external development teams able to build custom extensions, enhance security models, and integrate novel DeFi functionalities.\

Supernet Bridge is a non-custodial bridging mechanism that facilitates the secure transfer of assets, tokens, and data between independent blockchain networks (origin and target chains). Since networks like Juneo and Ethereum operate with distinct consensus mechanisms and architectures, bridges are essential for enabling seamless interoperability across ecosystems.

Users can seamlessly transfer tokens from **Ethereum (ETH), Base (ETH), BNB Chain, Chiliz (CHZ), Polygon (POL), Arbitrum (ETH)** **and Avalanche (AVAX)** to the **JUNE-Chain** through a **one-click bridge** available on the [Juneo Portal](https://portal.juneo.com/flashpass)**.** This integration expands cross-chain **liquidity and utility**, unlocking a broader range of **DeFi opportunities**.

### Core Features of the Supernet Bridge



**Non-Custodial Design:**\
\
Supernet Bridge eliminates the need for intermediaries by relying on a decentralized framework. Assets transferred via the bridge are securely managed through smart contracts and decentralized validators, ensuring full user control and minimizing risk.\


**One-Click Bridging:**\
\
Supernet Bridge is accessible through the [Juneo Portal](https://portal.juneo.com/flashpass), providing a streamlined user experience with one-click bridging functionality. This intuitive interface simplifies the transfer process, making it accessible even to non-technical users.



**Supported Networks:**

* Ethereum (ETH)
* Binance Smart Chain (BNB)
* Avalanche (AVAX)
* Base (ETH)
* Chiliz (CHZ)
* Polygon (POL)
* Arbitrum (ETH)



**Asset Management:**

* When bridging tokens, assets are locked on the source chain in a secure smart contract.
* Equivalent tokens are minted on the target chain, maintaining a 1:1 pegging ratio.
* Users can reverse the process by burning the minted tokens and unlocking the original assets.

***

### Interoperability and Scalability

Supernet Bridge supports multi-chain interoperability by acting as a gateway between different blockchain ecosystems. This functionality allows:



* dApps on Juneo to access liquidity and assets from other chains.
* Developers to build cross-chain applications with enhanced functionality.
* Users to move assets seamlessly, unlocking new opportunities within the DeFi and NFT sectors.

### How to Use the Supernet Bridge

1. **Visit the**[ **Juneo Portal**](https://portal.juneo.com/flashpass) and access the [Supernet Bridge](https://supernetbridge.io/)
2. **Connect your wallet** (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet) to the source network (ETH, BASE, ARB, BNB, CHZ, POL or AVAX).
3. **Select the tokens** you wish to bridge and specify the amount.
4. **Confirm the transaction** to lock the tokens on the source chain.
5. **Receive the equivalent tokens** minted on the **JUNE-Chain**.
6. **Get Started** [here](get-started.md).
