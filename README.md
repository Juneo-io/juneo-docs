# What is Juneo Supernet ?

Juneo Supernet is a public, decentralized Proof-of-Stake network powered by the **JUNE** token. \
Built on top of [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/), using the Snowman++ consensus mechanism, Juneo offers scalable, high-performance infrastructure for decentralized applications (dApps), DeFi, and AI agents.

The architecture of Juneo Supernet has been carefully redesigned to include new features such as:



* **Cost-Efficient & Accessible**\
  &#x20;A globally accessible, low-cost solution for deploying blockchain infrastructure



* **Unique Tokenomics & Fee Collection**\
  &#x20;Fees collected from network activities are used to sponsor transactions and fuel the ongoing development of the platform



* **Click-and-Deploy Tools**\
  &#x20;Easily create and deploy Layer-1 Networks and Supernets with minimal technical effort



* **Cross-Chain Transfers in Under 2 Seconds**\
  Seamless cross-chain transfers with instant interoperability

### A Platform for Creating Layer-1 Blockchains

Juneo Supernet is a platform that allows users and enterprises to easily create their own **Layer-1 Blockchains** which can operate independently or be grouped into **Supernets. Supernets** are collaborative networks of multiple Layer-1 chains that work together to offer the flexibility to launch and scale an unlimited number of blockchains, enabling efficient growth for decentralized applications and services.

At the heart of Juneo Supernet is the **Juneo Primary Network**, which acts as the **DeFi hub** and foundational infrastructure layer. It hosts **14 pre-deployed blockchains**, including:



* **12 EVM-compatible chains**, optimized for smart contract execution and DeFi applications
* **2 UTXO-based chains**, providing enhanced security and flexibility for different use cases



The Juneo Primary Network facilitates rapid **cross-chain transfers in just 2 seconds**, with a **1-second finality**, enabling fast interoperability within its ecosystem. As the backbone of the Juneo Supernet, it supports autonomous Supernets such as **Banana1, Fusion1** and **BlueByte1**, each running its own primary network designed for distinct use cases. Additionally, the creation of new Supernets is always a possibility, offering further flexibility and scalability.
