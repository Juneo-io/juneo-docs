# What is Juneo Supernet

Juneo Supernet is a public, decentralized Proof-of-Stake Network that utilizes the Native token JUNE.

The protocol is based on the innovative and robust Snowmann++ consensus from [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/).

The architecture has been redesigned with new functionalities added.

* **Cost-efficient solution** accessible to any team in the world&#x20;
* **Dedicated tokenomics** with fee collection to sponsor transactions&#x20;
* **Click and deploy tools** for Multi-Chain Networks and blockchains&#x20;
* **Cross-Chain transfers** in less than 2 seconds between chains

Juneo Supernet makes it possible to create networks of [**Nodes**](broken-reference) called [**Multi-Chain Networks**](broken-reference) **(MCNs)** that allow the creation of as many **blockchains** as needed.

Tests can be carried out on our [**Socotra Testnet**](the-juneo-network/join-the-socotra-testnet-v1.md). \
The **Mainnet** launch is planned for Q2 2024.
