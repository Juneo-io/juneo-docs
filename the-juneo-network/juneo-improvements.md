description: Juneo Supernet Core Features and Advantages
---

# Key Features

**✔️ Cost-Optimized Blockchain Deployment**

* Launching a Layer-1 blockchain on Juneo is 40x more affordable (in token terms) compared to traditional platforms like Avalanche or Cosmos
* Blockchain creation is simplified to a single transaction, like deploying a smart contract, no complex setup needed
* Stablecoin-based gas fees ensure predictable operational costs

***

**✔️ Higher decentralization**

* Achieved a Nakamoto Coefficient of 125+ in 6 months, outpacing many networks
* Aims for a maturity rating of 300+ for enhanced validator distribution and resilience
* Low staking requirement (100 JUNE) fosters broader validator participation and decentralization

***

**✔️ Multi-Layer, Multi-Asset Architecture**

* First Layer-1 with native multi-layer asset support
* Enables scalable, permissioned tokens, and specialized transactions (AI data, stablecoins, NFTs)
* Supports independent asset operation across multiple chains within the Supernet

***

**✔️ 12 pre-deployed blockchains**

* 12 pre-deployed, fully operational blockchains ready to use

***

**✔️  Token Conversion (ERC20 → Native Token)**

* Seamlessly bridges tokens from Ethereum, BNB Chain, or Avalanche, Polygon, Base and Chilliz.
* ERC20 tokens automatically convert into **JVM-native assets** when crossing from the **JUNE-Chain** to any target chain within the Supernet
* Users can immediately pay for gas fees and interact with smart contracts without wrapping or manual conversion
* ERC20 tokens can automatically be converted into EVM native tokens by crossing from the JUNE-Chain, enabling instant fee payment

***

**✔️ Optimized Network Fees**

* Transaction fees are up to **100x lower** than Ethereum
* Unlike Avalanche, Juneo does **not burn gas fees** — instead, fees are **recycled** via an auction and reward system, creating sustainable incentives for validators and users

***

**✔️ Native Blockchain Indexation**

* All chains are automatically indexed and integrated into [**Juneo Scan**](https://juneoscan.io/), the official Juneo explorer
* Indexation is maintained through **streaming fees** rather than relying on third-party indexers, ensuring real-time, on-chain data availability for dApps and users
